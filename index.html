  <h1>My Favorite Recipes</h1>
  <p>I don't cook, really. I find it stressful and messy and not worth the effort to just have a single meal and then bunch of stuff to clean up. But I do make these recipes. You will see that they are easy, and last more than one meal, or are VERY easy. None of them make a huge mess except for the hummus and tbh it's worth it. It would be more worth it with a larger food processor. Enjoy!</p>
