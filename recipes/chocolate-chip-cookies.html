  <img src="../images/cookies.png" alt="Stock image showing a small stack of chocolate chip cookies" height="300">

  <p>These cookies bake up well in Flagstaff, Arizona, about 7000 feet or 2134 meters elevation. They work in the big oven and also in a small toaster oven. See <a href="#reccs">Variations and Reccomendations</a> for details on making them just right.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2 1/2 cups flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <br>
    <li>1 cup butter aka two sticks (softened, not melted)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
    <br>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 tsp water</li>
    <br>
    <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped nuts (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Let any refrigerated ingredients come up to room temp.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C)</li>
    <li>Combine flour, soda, salt in a small bowl.</li>
    <li>Cream together butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla in a large bowl. Mix for at least five minutes. Watch for the color change and then mix for another minute or two.</li>
    <li>Add eggs, one at a time, to the butter mixture, beating well after each addition.</li>
    <li>Gradually beat in flour mixture and water into the wet ingredients until well combined.</li>
    <li>Stir in chips and nuts. One might even <strong>fold</strong> them in.</li>
    <li>Drop by rounded tablespoon onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
    <li>Bake 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Cool on baking sheets 2 minutes, then transfer to wire racks.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="reccs">Variations and Recommendations</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Bake on parchement paper for best results. This seems to work way better than silpats; I am really unsure of why.</li>
    <li>I don't actually measure when I put the dough on the baking sheet. I just put a hunk of dough that looks about right. Experiment to find what you like best.</li>
    <li>If you can stand to wait, refrigerate 30 minutes or more before baking.</li>
    <li>To have fresh cookies at any time with almost no work:  
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare freezer paper or a silpat, on a freezer safe sturdy surface that will fit in the freezer, like a plastic plate or wooden cutting board.</li>
        <li>Spoon out dough as if you were going to bake it, but onto the freezer paper.</li>
        <li>Freeze.</li>
        <li>Put frozen dough balls in a freezer bag or freezer safe container. Pyrex food storange container lids don't survive the freezer for me, so I use a freezer bag or cheap takeout plastic containers.</li>
        <li>Repeat until all dough is frozen.</li>
        <li>Bake from frozen, a minute or two longer than baking from unfrozen.</li>
        <li>Date your container. Search for more info if you are concerned, but I would toss them after a month. Like they would last a month in my house, lol.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure your baking soda isn't expired.</li>
    <li>I put a lot of vanilla because vanilla is delicious; reduce the vanilla to 1 tsp and increase water to 1 tbsp if that is more to your taste.</li>
    <li>To reduce sugar a bit, leave out the white sugar. The cookies are more cakey but not by much, and are still great.</li>
    <li>If you want more chocolate, increase the chocolate chips to 2 cups, or whatever works for you.</li>
    <li>I almost never cool on wire racks. I bet they would be better if I did but I have no patience.</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li>For a pan cookie (10×15 inch jelly-roll pan), prepare dough as above, and spread into greased pan, baking 17-19 minutes. (I've never done this, but it was in the original recipe)</li>
  </ul>
