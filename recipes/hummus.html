  <h1>Best Hummus Ever</h1>
  <img src="../images/empty-bowl.jpg" alt="Stock image showing an empty bowl" height="300">

  <p>Note: This recipe is written for a food processor.</p>

  <p>This hummus is absurdly good. The picture is an empty bowl because we always finish it before I think to take a photo. We eat it with chips, or pita bread, or chopped fresh veggies, or a spoon. See <a href="#reccs">Variations and Reccomendations</a> for more info.</p>

  <h2>Incredients</h2>
  <p>I typoed this as <em>incredients</em> and decided to keep it because this recipe is incredible.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 can chickpeas (drained, rinsed)</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
    <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp cumin (extremely optional)</li>
    <li>pinch cayenne or some jalape√±o, to taste (optional)</li>
    <li>1 bunch of cilantro
      <ul>
        <li>remove the biggest stems that are easy to chop, chop the rest finely enough that your food processor won't leave them in long strands
        <li>reserve some if you want to stir it in at the end to make it look prettier and have brighter pops of cilantro flavor</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>1 tbsp water</li>
    <li>juice from one whole lemon</li>
    <br>
    <li>6 tbsp (90 grams) tahini</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Combine chickpeas, garlic, salt, cumin, spicy, cilantro in food processor.</li>
    <li>Run proessor for 15 seconds.</li>
    <li>Scrape sides and start processor again.</li>
    <li>While running, add water and lemon juice, then run for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add tahini and oil, run until the consistency is what you want.</li>
    <li>If you reserved any cilantro, stir it in. One might even <strong>fold</strong> it in.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="reccs">Variations and Recommendations</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Substitute other things for cilantro, such as more garlic, or roasted red pepper.</li>
    <li>Increase or decrease spicy ingredients.</li>
    <li>To create your ideal texture:
      <ul>
        <li>Change the amount of food processing time.</li>
        <li>Reduce or increase water. If your cilantro is very wet you may want to leave the water out entirely.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
