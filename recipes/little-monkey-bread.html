  <p>When I had a lot more time I used to make my own bread. Sometimes I turned it into monkey bread and we would have enough for a small army of children, which was perfect. These days I need a smaller scale recipe. Check out the <a href="#reccs">Variations and Reccomendations</a> for details on scaling and other notes.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>One can of crescent roll dough (8 pieces)</li>
    <li>2 tsp granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp chunky salt</li>
    <li>2 tsp brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tbsp butter (melted)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F</li>
    <li>Reserve 2 crescent roll pieces.</li>
    <li>Grease an appropriately sized oven-safe container with butter</li>
    <li>In a small bowl combine granulated sugar, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
    <li>Cut the 6 pieces of crescent roll dough into 4 pieces each, and roll into balls</li>
    <li>Roll each piece of dough in the mixture and place in prepared baking dish.</li>
    <li>Stir brown sugar with butter and pour over the dough.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle any remainder of sugar and cinnamon over the dough.</li>
    <li>Bake for 20 minutes or until browned. Don't let it burn but make sure it's cooked through.</li>
  </ol>

<h2 id="reccs">Variations and Recommendations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I use a tiny little metal loaf pan and it's perfect for 6 crescent roll pieces.</li>
  <li>As written, this is a great shared dessert or can be for one if you are pretty hungry.</li>
  <li>Scale this up or down, it continues to work, but keep in mind that cooking times will vary greatly.</li>
  <li>Bake the two extra cresccent rolls and eat them as a snack while preparing the dessert.</li>
  <li>I tried adding chocolate by rolling a couple chocolate chips in each ball and substituting cocoa for cinnamon. It was pretty underbaked on the inside and nearly burned on the outside of each ball.</li>
</ul>
